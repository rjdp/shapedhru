						<h2>what SHE needs</h2>
						<p>There is a quote 'Charity begins at Home'. So we should start respecting and shower love to the women around us. A homemaker works 365 days a year throughout her lifetime. An initiative can be taken by giving a day's off. A maid comes to home daily to wash utensils, clean the floor and no body gives a second look to her or asks her how is she doing? Helping her overcoming her problems is a small thing but it is a change and no matter how small the spark of change is, continuous efforts can make it a wildfire.</p>

						<h2>what SHE gets</h2>
<p>Women have a very versatile and important role in people's life. For some they maybe a mother, for some they maybe a wife, for some they maybe a sister, for some they maybe a teacher and the list goes on and on. People know that their life would go out of track without women, but they tend to forget that very often. Even when the world says women and men are equal, there still exists discrimination between them. It's not like the role of women in society is much less than that of men. In truth, a woman plays a great role to shape the society because as a mother she is the one who will teach values and perceptions to her child, as a wife she supports her husband and as a teacher she teaches people about the true ways of life. Then why does there still exist so much discrimination between men and women and why is women empowerment in India not taken as a top priority issue?

						<h2>HER fight</h2>
						<p>You might be listening to news, reading newspaper or magazine, you would have gone through incidents and accidents with women in India. While any other article on women's empowerment in India will take a look at our rich heritage and enlightened societies of the past where women were treated as equals, the concept of "India" itself evolved quite recently, relative to the sum of its part's histories. But the TRUTH is that in the modern India, the woman has always been a second grade citizen, no matter what its esteemed leaders have said or done.
<br>
It is hard to fathom how slow moving the cultural exchange of the world is when you find out that there are several places across the country where harmful customs of the ancient world coexist with modern appliances and thought. However that may come as hardly any surprise to anyone who has lived in India - the dichotomy of society is something that can only be explained by a refrain from an old Bollywood song: "It happens only in India!"</p>

						<h2>help HER</h2>
						<p>Today, women who have been owned and organized their venture, who are in the politics and women who are in the  superlative and excellent positions are live examples to prove their strength. Fighting for women right is every human right.  With the increase in the number of social crimes, women's suffrage there is a greater demand for country to provided strong  protection of women from domestic violence. Although, the word "domestic violence" is heard very rare in developed  countries, this should be a sign For India that shows how imperative it is to provide social rights without gender inequality.</p>

						<h2>EDUCATION</h2>
						<p>Empowerment of women in the country is a process that has long been underway and the results are starting to show. The  enrollment figures for women in schools, colleges and other professional institutes have showed an improvement with more  women being involved in both technical and traditional job sectors. Women self-help groups have been setup in the rural  districts to fight for the right of women in India and provide a source of empowerment for them through various means. The  proposal for the passing of bills and laws in the Parliament towards protection of women against sexual assaults and  violence will be a major step forward towards setting up of women's rights in India. As and when the thirty-three per cent  reservation of seat for women in the Parliament gets completed, women of the nation will find a much louder voice for  themselves in the higher seats of power in the Indian democracy. That will be the day when India and its women will truly be  able to reach the zenith of empowerment and proudly claim the total establishment of rights of women in India.</p>
