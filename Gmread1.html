						<p><strong>  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp Child marriage is still a widely prevalent practice in West Bengal. Despite the fact that in the state of West Bengal had social reformers who led the country in thinking about women empowerment, this social evil is robbing the girls in the State of their right to live a life of dignity and freedom. 

The current situation:

Every second girl in the high prevalence child marriage districts of West Bengal were married off before they reach 18, the legal age for girls to get wedded, a UNICEF reported a couple of years back, with Murshidabad (61.04 per cent), Birbhum (58.03 per cent), Malda (56.07 per cent) and Purulia (54.03 per cent) being the worst off districts.

A TOI report of September 25th, 2013 says, Bengal is among the top four states in the country when it comes to child marriage. This nation wide survey which has been conducted by the Centre has revealed that of the total marriages that take place in Bengal, 54.7% are of minor girls.
The total number of underage married girls, who have also become mothers before attaining the age of 15 in Bengal stands at a whopping 27,082, which is the second highest in the country. <br>

The National Crime Records Bureau  that has recently released data for 2012, has mentioned how a total of 88 arrests , related to child marriage, were carried out by the cops in Bengal between 2008-12. And this figure, incidentally is the highest in the country.
