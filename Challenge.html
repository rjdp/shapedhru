<p>There are several challenges that are currently plaguing the issues of women's rights in India. A few of these challenges are  presented below. While a lot of these are redundant and quite basic issues faced across the country, these are contributory  causes to the overarching status of women in India. Targeting these issues will directly benefit the empowerment of women  in India.
</p>
<p>
While the country has grown from leaps and bounds since its independence where education is concerned, the gap  between women and men is severe. While 82.14% of adult men are educated, only 65.46% of adult women are known to be  literate in India. Not only is an illiterate women at the mercy of her husband or father, she also does not know that this is not  the way of life for women across the world. Additionally, the norms of culture that state that the man of the family is the be- all and end-all of family decisions is slowly spoiling the society of the country.

As said in a study conducted by the Centre for the Study of Society and Secularism,

In spite of the UN Charter of Human Rights and the provisions of the Indian Constitution, women continue to be victims of  exploitation. The view that the future generation of a family is carried on and preserved by boys-only has degraded the  position of women in society. Similarly, it is noticed that majority of the women are lacking in the spirit of rebellion. If careful  attention is not paid and major steps are not taken, the situation will become extremely critical.

Eradicating this gap and educating women about their real place in the world is a step that will largely set this entire  movement rolling down the hill to crash and break the wall of intolerance, negligence and exploitation.
