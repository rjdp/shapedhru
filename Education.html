				<p>India, the second most populous country in the whole world, has a total population of 1,220,800,359 million people, of  which 587.236.392 million are females between 0 years and 65 years and over, according to a July 2013 estimate provided  by the CIA World Factbook.</p>

<p>
Even though it is not a poor country anymore – the 4th most developed economy in the world, with a GDP of $4.761 trillion  in 2012, education is still a long term challenge in India, especially for young girls and women. A 2009 Indian government  report shows that the drop-out school rate was of 25% and includes girls and also poor and disabled children.</p>
<p>
Although women’s education is as important as men's education, girls are being banned from school by their families  because of the attacks and the sexual assaults the girls are victims of. Being afraid that these attacks will affect a girl's  honor, the family prefers to drop her out of school.</p>
<p>
Official numbers reveal the level of women's education in India. School life expectancy for Indian girls, from primary to  tertiary education, is of 10 years, while for boys is of 11 years. Studies also show that unemployment rate for young females  between ages 15-24 is of 11.5%, while for young boys between same ages is of 9.8%.</p>
<p>
Why is so hard for an Indian girl and or woman to go to school and complete her education? The answer is somewhere  between a dozen of reasons: because most of the people in India think that women are chattels or property and because  the government says girls should be educated but does too little in order to support them.</p>
